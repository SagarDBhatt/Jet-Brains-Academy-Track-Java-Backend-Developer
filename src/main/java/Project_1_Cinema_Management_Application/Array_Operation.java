/**
 * Problem statement:
 *
 * Write a method named addValueByIndex.
 *
 * The method should take an array of longs and add value to the specified element by its index.
 *
 * Here is a description of the parameters:
 *
 * an array of longs;
 * the index of an element (int);
 * a value for adding (long).
 * The method must return nothing.
 *
 * The following invocation should work correctly:
 *
 * addValueByIndex(array, index, value);
 * Where array is an array of longs, index is an integer variable, value is a long value for adding.
 *
 * Sample Input 1:
 *
 * 1 1 1 1 1
 * 2 100
 * Sample Output 1:
 *
 * 1 1 101 1 1
